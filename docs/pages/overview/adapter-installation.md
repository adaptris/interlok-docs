# Interlok Installation #

!> **NOTE:** **Interlok 4.0+ requires Java 11**.

Installation is pretty easy, however due to a change in Java licensing as of 2019 you need to provide your own 64bit JVM.
You have 3 choices for installation;
 - Manual zip download
 - Using our Java based installer
 - Using gradle

## Manual download

Use this method if you simply want to get Interlok up and running quickly.  Unless you know what you're doing when it comes to adding new components to Interlok you should use one of the other methods however.

Simply extract the following two zip files into the same directory and you're good to go;
